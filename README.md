## Container

### Docker Compose

This setup uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to build and run the app and manage a persistent SQLite database stored in a Docker volume.

#### Build the image

```bash
docker compose build
```

#### Start the app

```bash
docker compose up
```

> On first run, the container copies a pre-seeded SQLite database into a persistent volume
> On subsequent runs, that volume is reused and the data is preserved

#### Stop the app

```bash
docker compose down
```

#### Optional: database reset

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

> This removes the volume and will reinitialize the database from the built-in seed file the next time you `up`.

## Credits

The solution has been coded using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the official [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension.
